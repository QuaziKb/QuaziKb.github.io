<h1>Converging Diverging Rocket Nozzle</h1>
<br>
While taking a course on compressible fluid dynamics, we kept revisiting nozzle flow as an interesting example. 
This is seemingly because nozzle flow captures 1D compressible fluid dynamic problems quite well, and thus works well as an illustrative example.
However, I was quite bothered by the fact that I couldn't seem to find many nice visualizations of whats going on, so decided to make a little interactive toy to help better understand what was going on.
